# Probe-modelling harness (Blender)

Builds spacecraft models from Python scripts, checks them against sourced dimensions,
renders a contact sheet and exports `.glb` files for the site. Runs on Blender's bundled
Python; the command line needs only the system `python3`.

## Layout
- `lib/parts.py`: shared parts (dish, prism bus, box, truss/rod boom, RTG, panel, cylinder), in metres
- `lib/materials.py`: shared materials (foil, paint, metal, solar cells), Principled BSDF only
- `lib/rig.py`: review rig and contact sheet (front, three-quarter / side, top; metric grid on the orthographic views)
- `lib/checks.py`: dimension checks measured from the built geometry, triangle and file-size budgets
- `probes/<probe>.py`: one script per probe, `build(spec)` using `lib/`
- `specs/<probe>.json`: dimensions with sources and tolerances, budgets, reference model
- `refs/<probe>/`: reference images, shown on the dashboard
- `baselines/<probe>.png`: the approved contact sheet, for regression checks
- `templates/`: what `new` copies
- `addon/live_server.py`: runs inside Blender's GUI so builds land in the open session
- `build.py`: the build itself (spec → model → checks → render → export), headless or live
- `run.py`: the command line
- `blender.json`: pinned Blender version, path and live-server port
- `out/` (ignored): sheets, history, `.glb`/`.blend` per build and `status.json`

## Commands (from `frontend/`)
- `npm run blender`: open Blender with the live server (127.0.0.1 only)
- `npm run model <probe>`: build in the live session if one is open, else headless (`-- --headless` to force)
- `npm run model:all`: rebuild every probe; fails on a failing check or a sheet that changed against its baseline
- `npm run model:approve <probe>`: copy the last passing build to `public/models/` and make its sheet the baseline
- `npm run model:new <probe> "Title"`: start a probe from the templates
- `npm run model:status`, `npm run model:watch` (contact sheets inline in iTerm2)
- `python3 scripts/blender/run.py send <file.py>`: run any Python in the live session

The dev-only dashboard at `localhost:3000/models` follows builds as they happen: progress,
a 3D view of the export, the contact sheet, references, checks and history.

## Spec dimensions
```json
"dish_diameter": {"value": 3.66, "object": "dish", "measure": "diameter",
                  "tolerance": 0.03, "source": "https://..."}
```
`object` is a part name, a list of names, or `"*"` for the whole probe. `measure` is `x`, `y`
or `z` (world extent), `length` (along the first object's local Z) or `diameter` (twice the
largest distance from that axis). Tolerance is relative, default 3%.

`testprobe` is a fixture (`"fixture": true`), not a spacecraft: one of every part with made-up
values, so changes to `lib/` show against its baseline. Fixtures are never published.
